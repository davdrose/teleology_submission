# Data 

Here you will find anonymized data from all experiments.

## Experiment 1
 
Contains `experiment1.db` which includes trial and demographic data. 

## Experiment 2

 Contains `experiment2.csv` which includes the trial data and `experiment2_demographics.csv` which includes demographic data. The remaining files are for getting the probabilities of sentence completions for properties used in experiment 2. `bert_large_property_probabilities_blank.csv` is read into the python script and a column is added with the probabilities of completions and the completed file is returned as `bert_large_property_probabilities.csv`. Likewise for RoBERTa and BERT base.
 
 ## Experiment 3
 
 Contains `experiment3.csv` which includes the trial data for experiment 3 while `experiment3_demographics.csv` contains the demographic data.
 
  ## Experiment 4
 
 Contains `experiment4.csv` which includes the trial data for experiment 4 while `experiment4_demographics.csv` contains the demographic data.
