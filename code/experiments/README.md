## Experiment 1

[Pre-registration](https://osf.io/4dux6/?view_only=ace54f88f0434856b9ac02cfe6df651b)

In this experiment, participants were given 40 different properties and asked to categorize them as biological, behavioral, social or purpose. The properties used and the categories we expected people to place them into can be found in `experiment1_items.docx` The top four properties from each category were then used to create four creatures with those properties. These were then used in experiments 2 and 3. 

Experiment 1 was implemented in [psiturk](https://psiturk.org/)

## Experiment 2

[Pre-registration](https://osf.io/a92nj/?view_only=d64cc77d0de94414b3a20a6abad29724)

In this experiment, participants were given a creature with four properties (drawn from experiment 1). They then categorized each property as belonging to either the behavioral, biological, social or purpose categories. This was then repeated for for a new creature. After categorizing properties for a pair of creatures, participants were then told that one of the creatures was exposed to toxic waste and that it lost one of its properties and acquired the same type of property from the other creature. Participants then rated whether the creature was a member of its original category or a member of a new category. This was repeated for all four property types for the pair. The same thing was then repeated for the remaining pair of creatures. In total participants made eight ratings (two creature pairs and four properties for each pair). 

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the generic condition, the four properties were attributed to individuals using a bare plural generic (e.g., Vulpans). In the specific condition, the four properties were attribution to an individual using a definite singular (e.g., This Vulpan...). 

Experiment 2 was implemented in [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). If you download the files from this experiment folder, you can run the experiment locally by running index.html in your browser. To see the generic condition you will need to append `?condition=1` to the url and to view the specific condition you will need to append `?condition=2` to the url.

## Experiment 3

[Pre-registration](https://osf.io/zdegq/?view_only=4d8c2abdfc4e4e33a8de287fa627b6b2)


This experiment had the same design as experiment 2. The difference is that instead of a creature being exposed to toxic waste, participants simply learned about a new creature that had three properties from one creature in the pair and one property from the other creature in the pair. 

This experiment was also implemented in jsPsych. If you download the files from this experiment folder, you can run the experiment locally by running index.html in your browser. To see the generic condition you will need to append `?condition=1` to the url and to view the specific condition you will need to append `?condition=2` to the url.


## Experiment 4

[Pre-registration](https://osf.io/2a3x5/?view_only=2da045cac79b4b648fae27b3e3f63039)

This experiment had the same design as experiments 2 and 3. This was similar to experiment 3 in that participants simply learned about a new creature (offspring) that had three properties from one creature in the pair and one property from the other creature in the pair. 

This experiment was also implemented in jsPsych. If you download the files from this experiment folder, you can run the experiment locally by running index.html in your browser. To see the generic condition you will need to append `?condition=1` to the url and to view the specific condition you will need to append `?condition=2` to the url.
